This utility can calculate sequencing coverage or physical coverage as well as duplication rate
and details of specific block for each segments and whole genome by using SOAP, Blat, Blast, BlastZ,
mummer and MAQ aligement results with multi-thread. Gzip file supported.

Parameters:
  -cvg or -phy or -tag    Selector for sequencing coverage mode, physical coverage mode or reads tag mode
                          At least and only one should be selected!
  -refsingle [filename]   Input reference fasta file used in SOAP
  -i [soap-file1 soap-file2 ...]
                          Input several soap or soap gziped results by filenames.
  -il [soap-list]         Input several soap or soap gziped results (absolute path!) with a soap-list file
		Caution: Only PE aligned results can be used in physical coverage!
  -il_single [SE aligned results list]
  -il_soap [PE aligned results list]
  -o [file-name]          Results output with details
  -depth [directory]      Output coverage of each bp in seperate files, a directory should be given
  -depthsingle [filename] Output coverage of each bp in a single file (text, fasta like)
  -depthsinglebin [fn]    Output coverage of each bp in a single file (Binary mode)
  -addn [filename]        Input N block data for exclusion (marked as 65535 in depthsingle output)
		Input format: <segment_name> <start (numbering from 1)> <end (exclude the last)>
  -depthinput [filename]  Input previous coverage data (Both Text or Binary) for faster accumulation
  -cdsinput [filename]    Input specific block range for calculating coverage
		Input format: <segment_name> <start (numbering from 1)> <end (exclude the last)>
  -plot [filename] [x-axis lower] [x-axis upper]
                          Output overall distribution of coverage of all segments
  -cdsplot [filename] [x-axis lower] [x-axis upper]
                          Output distribution of coverage of specific blocks
  -cdsdetail [filename]
                          Output coverage of each bp of each specific blocks in a single file
  -window [filename] [length]
                          Output coverage averaged in a [length] long window to [filename]
  -p [num]                Number of processors [Default:4]
  -trim [num]             Exclude [num] bp(s) from head & tail of each segments

Input format seletors:
  -plain                  Input is a three column list
  -sam                    Input is a standard SAM input file
  -pslquery               Input is Blat for alculating query coverage.
  -pslsub                 Input is Blat for calculating subject coverage.
  -maq                    Input is MAQ output file.
  -m8subject              Input is Blast m8 file for calculating subject coverage (reference should be subject).
  -m8query                Input is Blast m8 file for calculating query coverage (reference should be query).
  -mummerquery [limit]    Input mummer result file for calculating query coverage.
  -axtoitg                Input Blastz axt file for calculating target coverage.
  -axtoiq                 Input Blastz axt file for calculating query coverage.

Special functions:
  -sp [filename_in] [filename_out]
                          Output S/P ratio data for post processing.
       Column:
           ref    start    end    name
  -pesupport [filename_in] [filename_out]
                          Output pair-end reads on specific areas.
       Column:
           ref    start    end    name
  -onlyuniq               Use reads those are uniquely mapped (column 4 in soap == 1).
  -precise                Omit mismatched bp in soap results.
  -nowarning              Cancel all possible warning.
  -nocalc                 Do not perform depth calculation.
  -onlycover              Only output 0 or 1 for coverage calculation.

Physical Coverage Specified Parameters:
  -duplicate [num]        Exclude duplications, and gives the percentage of duplication. [num]=readlength
  -insertupper [num]      Insert larger than num will be abandon [Default: 15000]
  -insertlower [num]      Insert shorter thab num will be abandon [Default: 0]

Example:
	1. Calculate several files of SOAP results.
	   soap.coverage -cvg -i *.soap *.single -refsingle human.fa -o result.txt 

	2. Calculate a list of SOAP results, exclude Ns blocks, output depth to
	   a file and plot coverage form depth 0 to 1000.
	   soap.coverage -cvg -il soap.list -refsingle human.fa -o result.txt -depthsingle all.coverage -addn n.gap -plot distribution.txt 0 1000

	3. Calculate a list of SOAP results, use only uniquely mapped reads, exclude Ns blocks
	   , output depth to a file and plot coverage form depth 0 to 1000.
	   soap.coverage -cvg -il soap.list -onlyuniq -refsingle human.fa -o result.txt -depthsingle all.coverage -addn n.gap -plot distribution.txt 0 1000

	4. Add new SOAP results to depth(-depthsingle) already calculated &
	   plot all data and specific blocks from depth 0 to 150, with 6 processors.
	   soap.coverage -cvg -depthinput all.coverage -refsingle human.fa -il soap.list -p 6 -o result.txt -cdsinput cds.list -plot distribution.txt 0 150 -cdsplot distribution_cds.txt 0 150

	5. Calculate physical coverage and duplication rate(read length=44) with
	   insert between (avg-3SD, avg+SD)[avg=197, SD=9], with 8 processors
	   soap.coverage -phy -il soap_without_single.list -refsingle human.fa -p 8 -o result.txt -duplicate 44 -insertlower 170 -insertupper 224
