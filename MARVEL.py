##### for larger genomes (> 100MB) LAstitch can be run with the -L option (preload reads)
##### with the -L option two passes over the overlap files are performed:
##### first to buffer all reads and a second time to stitch them
##### otherwise the random file access can make LAstitch pretty slow.
##### Another option would be, to keep the whole db in cache (/dev/shm/)
q.block("{path}//LAstitch -L -f 50 {db} {db}.{block}.las {db}.{block}.stitch.las")

##### create quality and trim annotation (tracks) for each overlap block and merge them

q.single("{path}//TKmerge -d {db} q")

##### detects "borders" in overlaps due to bad regions within reads that were not detected
##### in LAfix. Those regions can be quite big (several Kb). If gaps within a read are
##### detected LAgap chooses the longer part oft the read as valid range. The other part(s) are
##### discarded
##### option -L (see LAstitch) is also available

##### based on different filter critera filter out: local-alignments, repeat induced-alifnments
##### previously discarded alignments, ....
##### -r repeats, -t trim1 ... use repeats and trim1 track
##### -n 500  ... overlaps must be anchored by at least 500 bases (non-repeats)
##### -u 0    ... overlaps with unaligned bases according to the trim1 interval are discarded
##### -o 2000 ... overlaps shorter than 2k bases are discarded
##### -p      ... purge overlaps, overlaps are not written into the output file
##### option -L (see LAstitch) is also available
q.block("{path}//LAfilter -L -n 100 -r repeats -t trim1 -T -o 2000 -u 0 {db} {db}.{block}.gap.las {db}.{block}.filtered.las")

##### merge all filtered overlap files into one overlap file
q.single("{path}//LAmerge -S filtered {db} {db}.filtered.las")

##### create overlap graph
q.single("{path}//OGbuild -t trim1 {db} {db}.filtered.las {db}.graphml")

##### tour the overlap graph and create contigs paths
q.single("{path_scripts}/OGtour.py -c {db} {db}.graphml")

##### create contig fasta files
q.single("{path_scripts}/tour2fasta.py -c {db}_CORRECTED -t trim1 {db} {db}.tour.graphml {db}.tour.paths")

### optional: create a layout of the overlap graph which can viewed in a Browser (svg) or Gephi (dot)
q.single("{path}//OGlayout -R {db}.tour.graphml {db}.tour.layout.svg")
q.single("{path}//OGlayout -R {db}.tour.graphml {db}.tour.layout.dot")
